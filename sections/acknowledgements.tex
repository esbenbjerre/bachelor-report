I wish to recognize the invaluable support of my advisor, Magnus Madsen. Without his guidance and encouragement, this report would not have been realized. Magnus has been a wise and patient advisor and I hope to learn more from him in the future.

Thanks to Anders MÃ¸ller for his course on programming languages, which sparked my interest in functional programming.

Thanks to Sif for her tolerance and patience during the past three years. You always remind me, that there is more to life than university. I look forward to picking the first strawberries in our garden.

Lastly, thanks to my family for their support throughout the years.
